# General Approach for Solving Programming Problems
1. Make sure you understand the task. Repeat it to show that to yourself and the interviewer
2. Don’t begin by writing code immediately!
3. Ask questions about the task, inputs, assumptions, formats; most questions are under specified on purpose
4. Assume nothing! Or state you’re doing so
5. Think out loud, share what you’re thinking (brainstorm)
6. Try to show how you think thru the issue
7. Silence isn’t good, long ones are bad
8. Make sure the interviewer has a clear idea of how you’re doing (so they can help!)
9. Start with a simple example, later add detailed ones
10. Clarify the function signature of the problem early on. This will help focus your thoughts, and possibly invite subtle guidance from your interviewer
11. Start with a simple inefficient solution (simple != easy)
12. Improve the inefficient one
13. Break down the problem to parts
